I searched a lot on internet and I couldn't find a single code for my 128x64 LCD display (I was only finding OLED ones), until I found this czech site, with a working code for my LCD.


The problem is, that it is czech.


This repository is an open source project to translate it, and to improve it.

The credits for the original code goes to the author. Thanks, czech guy!
