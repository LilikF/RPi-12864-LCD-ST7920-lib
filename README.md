HISTORY:

I searched a lot on internet and I couldn't find a single code for my 128x64 LCD display (I was only finding OLED ones), until I found this czech site, with a working code for my LCD. The problem is, that it was in czech.

This repository is an open source project to translate it, and to improve it.


THE LIBRARY:

The library is working, almost everything is in english, and most you can understand.

This new code also adds new functions, for drawing and to improve the performance of it.
